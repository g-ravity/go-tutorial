# Go Tutorials

This repository contains a collection of Go tutorials. Each tutorial is a standalone program that can be run from the command line.

List of Projects:

- Basic Hello World
- Basic Web Server (serving static files)

The Notes folder contains my notes on the Go language. It is derived from the courses I have taken on Udemy and the projects in this folder, and some occasional youtube videos.

Feel free to browse through this resource to learn more about Go! Hope it helps you in some way.
